    I am a  Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, with prior experience in cross-modal information retrieval and dataset selection through reinforcement learning. Alongside my academic work, I am a year-round research intern at Sandia National Laboratories, where I focus on anomaly detection in various scenarios.
