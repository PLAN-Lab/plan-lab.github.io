    I am currently a Ph.D. student at the Computer Science Department, Virginia Tech. My advisor is Professor Ismini Lourentzou. My research interests include multimodal machine learning and its application to embodied AI and autonomous agents. I got my MS from Virginia Tech as well, in the area of machine learning and NLP. I am also and external collaborator at Lawrence Livermore National Lab.
