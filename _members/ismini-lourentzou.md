I am Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Virginia Tech, where I lead the Perception and LANguage (PLAN) Lab. I am also a member of the Sanghani Center for Artificial Intelligence and Discovery Analytics, and an affiliate faculty member of the National Security Institute and the Center for Advanced Innovation in Agriculture. My work revolves around (1) machine learning challenges related to data, e.g., learning with limited imperfect supervision, self-supervision, zero-shot learning, adversarial training, and (2) multi-modal learning with applications to vision + language, e.g., embodied AI, language grounding, text-to-video generation, talking-head synthesis, (bio)medical imaging, etc. Overall, I am interested in building intelligent task assistants that augment human intelligence.
