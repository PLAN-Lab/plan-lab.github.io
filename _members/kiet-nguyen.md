Hello! My name is Kiet Nguyen. I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, with a research focus on multimodal deep learning at large. Specifically, my work centers on pixel-grounded Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Additionally, my research interests also include multimodal truth verification and entailment. Throughout my research, I have gained extensive experience with both Large Language Models (LLMs) and LVLMs, including designing, implementing, and training on diverse multimodal datasets. In my free time, I bake, sing, and occasionally bike.
