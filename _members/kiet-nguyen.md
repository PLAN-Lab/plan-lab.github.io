Hello! I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student at Virginia Tech, working under Dr. Ismini Lourentzou's supervision. My main research interest lies in multimodal truth verification, with my two main current projects tackling visual misinformation detection and multidocument multimodal entailment. In particular, I seek to include fine granularity in my research to facilitate explainable misinformation detection. Overall, I am excited by all things multimodal (visual-textual-aural) machine learning, but especially research that addresses and helps to solve societal issues. I am also a graduate teaching assistant, currently helping with Dr. Lourentzou's CS 5824 course (Advance Machine Learning).

I am from Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. I obtained my Bachelor of Arts degree in Computer Science and Music Theory (with a Math minor) at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin, USA. My hobbies include all things baking and musicâ€”in my down time, I like to bake and sing. I am currently a member of Virginia Tech's Naturally Sharp A Cappella.
