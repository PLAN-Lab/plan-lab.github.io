    I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Computer Science at UIUC, working with Dr. Ismini Lourentzou. I was initially a Phd student from Virginia Tech where I was also working under Dr. Kurt Luther. Prior to my Ph.D. studies, I completed my Master’s degree in Computer Science at Georgetown University and obtained a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota, Twin-Cities.
