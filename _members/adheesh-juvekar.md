Hi! I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech advised by Dr. Ismini Lourentzou. My research interests are in applications of Deep Learning in the domain of (but not limited to) Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision.

I am a Fall 19 MS admit at Virginia Tech. Because of my curiosity and interest in the field of research, I converted to Ph.D. in the Fall of 2020. I worked with different advisors in VT before joining the PLAN lab in the Fall of 2021. I enjoy working in the rapidly-growing field of multimodal deep learning by utilizing and improving state-of-the-art technologies.

My other interests include all kinds of indoor and outdoor sports(member of Virginia Tech Cricket Club), and spirituality.
