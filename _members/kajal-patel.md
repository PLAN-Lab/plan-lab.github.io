I'm a Stamps Scholar and NCSA SPIN student researcher at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, majoring in Computer Science with minors in Statistics and Psychology. 
My current research focus is Open-World Scene Graph Generation with Large Vision-Language Models.
While my interests primarily lie in the fields of computer vision and explainable machine learning, I am open to researching and learning about any facet of computer science, statistics, or psychology.
