    I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, with research expertise in Information Retrieval, Robust ML, Multimodal ML, and Self-Supervised Learning. Alongside my academic work, I have extensive industry experience as a Software and ML Engineer, having completed three internships at IBM Research where I worked on projects in ontology construction and large language model evaluation. My academic and industry experiences provide me with a well-rounded perspective on the challenges and ethical considerations of AI content generation, enabling me to lead innovative research efforts aimed at addressing real-world problems.
