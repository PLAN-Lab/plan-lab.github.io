I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the Computer Science Department, Virginia Tech. My advisor is Professor Ismini Lourentzou. I am an instructor of record for CS2114 (Software Design and Data Structures) at VT. My research interests includes multimodal machine learning, specially speech recognition/separation.

I was born and raised in Alexandria, Egypt. I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer & Communication Engineering, Alexandria University. My interests and hobbies include enjoying nature, that's why I love Blacksburg.
