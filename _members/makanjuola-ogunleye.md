    Hello! Iâ€™m a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Virginia Tech, working in the Perception and LANguage (PLAN) Lab under the supervision of Dr. Ismini Lourentzou. My research focuses on AI and Machine Learning, particularly in enhancing Vision-Language Learning systems. Recently, I demonstrated with impressive results, how Emergent Communication can enhance Vision-Language Pretraining. My broader research interests include Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM alignment, and Multimodal Machine Learning. I also have valuable internship experience from leading tech companies and Fortune 500 organizations, including Intuit Inc., Northwestern Mutual, and KPMG.
