I'm a budding machine learning engineer with an ardent interest in deep learning. I'm an accelerated MS student at Virginia Tech in the senior year of my Bachelors in Computer Science, and a reciepient of the David Heilman Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Research. My research interests lie in computer vision, in the areas of object detection; object recognition; pose estimation, dataset quality, and dataset generation. I'll be completing my undergrad in May 2023 and continue onto my MS thesis thereafter. When I'm off research, I like going for a swim, working out, hiking, cycling, playing badminton, and making new friends. The four most important values to me are accountability, commitment, compassion, and integrity.
