I'm a budding machine learning engineer with an ardent interest in deep learning. I'm an accelerated MS student at Virginia Tech, and a recipient of the David Heilman Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Research. My research interests lie in computer vision, in the areas of object detection, object recognition, pose estimation, dataset quality, and dataset generation. I completed my undergrad in May 2023 and continued on my MS thesis thereafter. When I'm off research, I like going for a swim, working out, hiking, cycling, playing badminton, and making new friends. The four most important values to me are accountability, commitment, compassion, and integrity.
