    I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science at Virginia Tech, working under the supervision of Dr. Ismini Lourentzou. My research focuses on artificial intelligence, deep learning, multimodal machine learning, and natural language processing, with applications in healthcare and other sectors. I leverage the synergy between vision and language in my work to develop models aimed at creating a positive societal impact.
