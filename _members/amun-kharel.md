I am a second year PhD student at Virginia Tech.
I believe my fellow human beings are infinitely valuable, which is why I chose computer science because I can leverage my skills to bring joy to people. For example: If there is a tedious task that requires human effort that could be done more efficiently, I would love to work on those problems. Time flies when I am solving math or Computer science problems.
My Research Interests are- Embodied Artificial Intelligence, Applied Computer Vision.
Experience- I have worked 3 years as a web-developer as an undergraduate (prior to coming to VT) and currently I work as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for the computer science department at VT.
