    I am currently a Ph.D.  student in the Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech under the supervision of Dr. Ismini Lourentzou. Before that, I obtained my M.Sc. degree in Computer Science at Austin Peay State University, Clarksville, Tennessee, USA and B.Sc. in Mathematics at Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, Anambra State, Nigeria.  I love reading exciting articles and books or watching interesting discoveries. I also love mentoring young people.
