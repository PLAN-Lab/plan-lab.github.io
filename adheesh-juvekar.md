    I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student at PLAN Lab, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign advised by Dr. Ismini Lourentzou. My research interests are in Generative AI (Diffusion, VLMs, LLMs) and Multimodal Machine Learning. My current projects include improving video generation in the talking heads domain and scene graph generation for open vocabulary. Apart from my academic research, I also have industry research experience in NLP and Computer Vision as an intern at Deloitte and Amazon. My other interests include all kinds of indoor and outdoor sports, and spirituality.
